Notes on use with the CodeChat System
======================================
Compared to a standard ``conf.py`` Sphinx configuration file generated by ``sphinx-quickstart``, the `conf.py` in this project:

-   Includes the CodeChat extension and associated settings; simply search for "CodeChat" in `conf.py` for more information.
-   The ``sphinx-build`` executable is provided with an output directory of ``_build`` (see `codechat_config.yaml`), which matches the output directory for the CodeChat system also specified in `codechat_config.yaml`.

To use these files, simply copy them to a new project directory of your choice. Open them in your preferred text editor/IDE, then use a appropriate CodeChat extension/plugin to open any of these files to build and view the results.
