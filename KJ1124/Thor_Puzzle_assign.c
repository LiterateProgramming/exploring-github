General Instructions
--------------------

**Objective**

Write a program that will guide Thor to reach the light of power in the most efficient manner.

**Game Rules**

Thor will move on this map that has the coordinates of 40 wide by 18 high. As the light of power changes locations your goal is change the direction of Thor's movements based on the coordinate placement of the light of power.


*Note: You can utilize any coding language that you are most comfortable with to write this code by changing this option in the code tab. I chose to use C++*

    // The cin.ignore() function is used to ignore characters that may not belong in your input buffer
    cin >> light_x >> light_y >> initial_thor_x >> initial_thor_y; cin.ignore();

    // This while statement is the beginning of the beginning of the game loop and it allows causes all of your test cases to run
    while (1) {
        int remaining_turns; 
        // This is the remaining amount of turns Thor can move. Do not remove this line.
        cin >> remaining_turns; cin.ignore();

Diagrams
---------

.. image:: ThorPwr.jpg

**This a diagram of Thor at his starting postion. The red arrows are pointing at the XY plane and the compass below so that you can have a clear orientation of Thor as he moves within the boundary conditions.** 

.. image:: GameInfo.jpg

**This is the games console output and is located underneath the image of Thor moving as he moves with each test case. It shows Thor's position and the light position as he moves across the board. This also shows the amount of energy consumption is being utilized to get to where you are making Thor travel. Both of your X and Y coordinates should either increment or decrement based on the postion of Thor in relation to the light of power.**

Variables
----------
The directions below are the variables used to output the direction in which you want Thor to go at the end of each game turn.Each movement makes Thor move by 1 cell the direction chosen

*       N (North) 
*       NE (North East) 
*       E (East)
*       SE (South East) 
*       S (South)
*       SW (South West) 
*       W (West)
*       NW (North West)
 
Thor's Movement

**This image shows the XY cooridinate graph as it is represented in this program. The arrows show how the coordinates with either increase or decrease based on the direction Thor is moving towards in.**

    /*
        In this case the light of power at the X and Y coordinates are greater than Thor's initial condition so, two if condition statements must to be implemented. Futhermore, the Y coordinate values increase as you go South and the X coordinates vale increase as you go further East. Thor's initial X and Y conditions must be incremented so he can move in the South East without going pass the MAX boundary for both the X and Y parameters.
